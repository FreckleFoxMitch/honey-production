Honey Production

As you may have already heard, the honeybees are in a precarious state right now. You may have seen articles about the decline of the honeybee population for various reasons. I want to investigate this decline and how the trends of the past predict the future for the honeybees.

The dataset about honey production in the United States was taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/honey-production).

This project based on linear regression and requires numpy, pandas, matplotlib and scikit-learn.
